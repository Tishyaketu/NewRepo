so now the app should:
1. In the Login page add not signed up? register now button to take to register page, similarly for register page as well redirect to login page
2. Implement following authentications:
 2.1 if username and/or password not entered and clicked on login, show enter username & password
 2.2 if username does not exist render user does not exist
 2.3 if username exists but password incorrect render invalid credentials
 2.4 if correct username and password direct to tasks page
 2.5 while registering if username exists render user already exists
3. Add confirm password field for registering user, register user if both the passwords matches
4. in tasks page create task table, if no existing tasks render no tasks available, else render tasks row by row
5. add modals for create, update, delete tasks
6. Add standard styles for the pages
7. once logged in and on tasks page then user can only logout and cannot navigate to register or login page
